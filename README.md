## Description
POI Islands of Ireland allows users create their own unique repository of islands. The App allows users to define:
* Island Regions (North East, East Coast, South Coast, Mid West)
*	Island Name
* Description
* Latitude / Longitude details
*	Upload multiple images per Island

Users are able to signup and access the App instantly. If a member requires a new Regions name to be added they can request this from the Administrator (request currently not available via the App). Once the Administrator creates the new region it is instantly available to the member. They can add  and search islands using this new region.

Members can add/modify/delete islands and also categorise the list of islands based on region in the main dashboard. They can also select to display ‘All Regions’ which will display all islands administered. The members name and island Count is displayed on the dashboard.

A Settings tab is available to the member to change their account details.

Members can edit an island, this will open a new page where the member can modify all fields relating to the island. From here the member can also upload one or multiple images for that Island. 

The member has the ability to delete individual images from the island edit screen. The user can also delete the island from the main dashboard which will in turn delete the images from Cloudinary.

The administrator dashboard will see the list of members and a total count of their islands. The administrator can click on each member to view their list of islands where they have the ability to then delete individual islands belonging to the member. 

The administrator can also opt to delete members from the admin dashboard which will in turn delete all associated islands and their images on Cloudinary.

The administrator can create a new region. The list of current regions will also be displayed, individual regions can be deleted. The affect of this on the member is a blank name appearing for that island for the member.
